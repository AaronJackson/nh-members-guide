The Blue room
=============

The Blue Room is provided as a peaceful area where members can work if there is a large event going on in the main space, wish to work in a small group, or simply wish to work quietly on their laptop or one of the PCs open to use by members. In winter, itâ€™s also one of the smaller areas of the Hackspace that can be heated more economically than the other rooms.

The Blue Room contains printers that are available for use by members, please consider a donation for large print runs to help towards the cost of toner and consumables. USB charging points are also available on the central table.
