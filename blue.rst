The Blue room
=============

The blue room is a members-only area of the space. Inside it are several desks, the Nottinghack library, a large co-working table, several printers, a dual screen PC, a drawing table and a large on-wall monitor. It’s provided as a peaceful area where members can work if there is a large event going on in the main space. In winter, it’s also one of the smaller areas of the hackspace that can be heated economically.
