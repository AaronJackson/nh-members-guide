Children
========

The Hackspace welcomes children, but please be aware that it is primarily an adult environment. While of course we won’t be screening porn or having strippers in the space, outside of workshops specifically aimed at kids, members might not be watching their language. Additionally, the space has some very dangerous tools and potentially dangerous chemicals around. Under 18s must  be accompanied by an adult and are generally expected to be engaged with the space in some way, i.e. working on a project of some kind while they’re here.

Young adults aged between 16 and 18 can join, but one of their parents or guardians will need to meet with a trustee at the Hackspace to understand the risks involved.

Periodically, we do have events specifically for children of all ages.
