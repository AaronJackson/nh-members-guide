Cleaning and Improving the Space
================================

The hackspace is run, cleaned, organised, maintained by YOU - thats every hackspace member.

One of the best things to do as a member is to clear-up just a little bit more, that way the space is more usable for everyone.

Work-surfaces that are regularly used, such as the benches in the workshop & the large table in the blue room, are designated as clear zones. Please make sure to clear these areas after working on them.

We ask everyone to do their bit to keeping the places clean and tidy and ensuring worksurfaces are free for everyone to use.

To help this happen we organise semi-regular clean-the-space evenings and hack-the-space days where we work together to keep the place nice. There is sometimes free pizza.

Clean-the-space Tuesdays
------------------------
The second Tuesday in every month is usually a cleaning evening. There is sometimes the offer of free pizza to spur people into action. This is member-led, so please check the google group to see if this is happening on a particular month.

Hack-the-space Sundays
----------------------
These are usually the first Sunday of the every month. We try to make an area within the space a bit better, for example by improving storage or tools. We also do some clearing, tidying and cleaning. The best way to find out if this is happening is to check the google group.

We like to give each Hack-the-space a focus as we find doing this really drives the work and leaves us with something amazing and concrete at the end of the day.
