Comfy Area
==========

The comfy are is a place where people tend to congregate and socialise. With a projector, soft furnishings, coffee tables, and shelves full of books, it's an excellent place to relax.

A sound system and Raspberry Pi is available for use along with the projector.

The museum of oddities exists for us to showcase interesting items that we've collected over the years, from decades old consoles to an Amstrad phone. These items are not available for hacking, but if you've got something quirky you'd like to donate for display then feel free to let us know.

The library is available for reading while in the Hackspace, please feel free to make full use of it. We don't currently have a system for lending out books, but this is being worked on.

For more information about the Comfy Area see the wiki `Comfy Area <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Comfy_Area>`_, we also have a page for using the `AV setup <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Comfy_Area_AV>`_.
