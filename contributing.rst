Contributing
============

**Noticed anything missing from this guide?** We encourage members, new and old, to make changes to this guide. This can be done by opening a pull request on GitHub.

https://github.com/NottingHack/members-guide

You do not need to know how to use Git in order to make changes. As long as you have a GitHub account, you can edit the pages from the GitHub website. When saving, it will ask you to make a pull request against the `main` branch.

The guide is formatted using reStructuredText - hopefully there are enough examples across the other pages to help you can an idea of how to work with this.

If all of that sounds too scary, you're also welcome to propose changes by emailing them to the membership team, or by posting them on Discord.
