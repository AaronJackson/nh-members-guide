Craft Room
==========

The craft room contains consumables for you to use. This ranges from basics such as needles, threads and fabrics to kits such as lace making, candle making or mosaic tiles.

You are welcome to use any of the goods in the craft room, but we ask you keep the area free of projects and do not leave clutter in the space, as the room is small.

We are always happy to take suggestions of kits or improvements youâ€™d like to see to the contents of the Craft Room.
