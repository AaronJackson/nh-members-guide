Craft Room
==========

The craft room (also known as the Textiles Workshop) contains consumables for you to use, as well as specilised tools and equipment for crafty projects. This ranges from basics such as needles, threads, and fabric to kits for lace making, candle making, mosaic tiles, and more.

We are always happy to take suggestions of kits or improvements youâ€™d like to see to the contents of the Craft Room, simply contact the Craft team to get involved.
