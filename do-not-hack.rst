Do Not Hack
===========

Do Not Hack, also known as 'DNH', is how you mark your project as a project inside the Hackspace. The skills and tools in the Hackspace mean a wide variety of projects are being constructed at any given moment; a Do Not Hack label (and proper storage) is how you make sure your project can't be mistaken for simply being components or materials when someone tidies up.

Approved Do Not Hack labels can **only** be generated using the `Hackspace Management System (HMS) <https://hms.nottinghack.org.uk>`_ and will automatically include all the details needed as defined in the Hackspace rules for `Do Not Hack <https://rules.nottinghack.org.uk/en/latest/do-not-hack.html>`_. 

The letters **'DNH'** on their own **do not** constitute a correct label.

Generating a label
------------------

To generate a Do Not Hack label first go to the `Hackspace Management System (HMS) <https://hms.nottinghack.org.uk>`_ and log in.

Once logged in you can navigate to the 'Projects' area using the navigation buttons.

Using the 'Add New Project' button lets you create a new project, simply completing a title and short description is all thatâ€™s required. 

Once your project is saved; simply click the 'Print DNH Label' option to get your label printed automatically! The printer on the Large Project Shelves will create you a custom sticker containing all the necessary information, ready to be applied.

Note the **Print** button will only appears while in the Hackspace and using the hackspace network.
