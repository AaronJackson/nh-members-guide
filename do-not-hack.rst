Do Not Hack
===========

If possible please take any projects home with you after working on them. This helps to reduce clutter and make sure work space is available to everyone

If you really do need to store a project outside of your 35l box, please only do this on the large storage shelves within the studio area.

All projects should be recently worked upon as we do not want lots of half-finished projects taking up space. If your project has not been worked on for more than three months then it may be removed from the hackspace.

To ensure this make sure to securely attach a “do not hack” sign, along with your name, contact details & the date.

“Do Not Hack” signs ***MUST*** have a ***name, contact details*** and ***date*** on them to be valid.

You must also fill in the list on the end of the shelves along with the last date the project was worked upon.
