Do Not Hack
===========

Do Not Hack, also known as 'DNH', is how you mark your project as a project inside the Hackspace. The skills and tools in the Hackspace mean a wide variety of projects are being constructed at any given moment; a DNH label (and proper storage) is how you make sure your project can't be mistaken for simply being components or materials when someone tidies up.

DNH labels can be found in several areas of the Hackspace, primarily on the LPS and the member storage box racks. These labels ask for several details:

* Name: This is how someone knows who owns the project.
* Project: A short description or title of the project being worked on.
* Date: The date the project was last worked on. Make sure this is kept up to date!
* Email: How a member can contact you regarding your project if necessary.
