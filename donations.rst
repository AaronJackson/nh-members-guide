Donations
=========

No one is obliged to make any extra monetary contribution above their membership payment, however we do accept donations.

Monetary donations
------------------
If you would like to make a monetary donation , simply pace it in one of the donation pots throughout the Hackspace.

Equipment donations
-------------------
We only have limited space so at present the general rule is NOT to accept donations of old or obsolete equipment.

We are interested in donations of good-quality components, tools and test equipment. The best way to see if the Hackspace would like a donation of equipment is to make a list, and take photographs, then email these to the Google Group.

Please do NOT bring donations to the space without asking on the Google Group first.
