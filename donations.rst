Donations
=========

No one is obliged to make any donations above the membership fee they choose, but people often do.

Monetary donations
------------------
If you would like to make a monetary donation for any reason then there are donation pots throughout the space.

Equipment donations
-------------------
We only have limited space so at present the general rule is NOT to accept donations of old or obsolete equipment.

We are interested in donations of good-quality components, tools and test equipment. The best way to see if the hackspace would like a donation of equipment is to make a list and take a photograph and then email these to the Google group.

Please do NOT bring donations to the space without asking on the Google group first.
