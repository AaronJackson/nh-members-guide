Regular Events
==============

Every Wednesday from 18:30 is the open hack night. The public are welcome to come and have a look around, talk to willing members about the space and use the tools and consumables.

We lead regular workshops on various subjects which are often member-led. Upcoming events are promoted on the google group, in the newsletter and on the HMS calendar: http://nottinghack.org.uk/?page_id=309. We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in running a workshop too.

Many other regular events happen, which are all member-led. These include: Photography group, Retro Computing group, Bad Movie Night, Music Jam Sessions. Details of these events is usually given in the regular newsletter. Please also see the Google forum for more details about these events and when they are running.
