Regular Events
==============
Our regular Open Hack Night takes place every Wednesday, between 18:30 and 21:00. The public are welcome to come and have a look around, get a tour, talk to willing members about the space, and use the tools and consumables for their projects. We also have occasional Open Days on Saturdays, which are organised by the Membership team and promoted by the Comms team.

Exhibition days happen occasionally.On these days we ask members to come into the space to work and demonstrate their projects, so the public are able to visit the Hackspace and understand more about who we are and what we do.

There are regular workshops, talks and groups on various subjects, which are often member-led and typically open to the public as well. Upcoming events are promoted on our social media, in the newsletter, the Google Group,  and on the Nottinghack homepage. We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in running a workshop, a talk, or a regular group. Not sure how to run an event? Our Events team are happy to help you plan and run something.
