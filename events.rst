Regular Events
==============
We run weekly Membership Tours with tickets available on Eventbrite, `for more information see our website <https://nottinghack.org.uk/about-2/join-us/>`_.

We have occasional Open Days on Saturdays, which are organised by the Membership team and promoted by the Comms team.

Exhibition days happen occasionally. On these days we ask members to come into the space to work and demonstrate their projects, so the public are able to visit the Hackspace and understand more about who we are and what we do.

There are regular workshops, talks and groups on various subjects, which are often member-led and typically open to the public as well. Upcoming events are promoted on our social media, in the newsletter, the Google Group, and on the Nottinghack homepage. We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in running a workshop, a talk, or a regular group.

Aiming to run an event? Contact the Trustees (a requirement for a public facing event) and read about the process for events on the wiki which includes guidelines for risk assessments and how we advertise and ticket events: https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Events
