Guests
======

Outside of open hack nights, guests are welcome at Nottingham Hackspace if accompanied by a member. It’s expected that if they’re using the space & any consumables or facilities within it, they or the member that invited them makes an appropriate donation. Please do not give out the wifi password or door codes to people who are not hackspace members.

Guest wifi is available.  You can find the password on notices in the Studio.
