Health & Safety
===============

Health & Safety is the responsibility of every member of Nottingham Hackspace.

The hackspace has a lot of potentially dangerous tools available to members, and rather than mess around with them, you should ask to be inducted on any machine or tool you haven’t used before. Generally, another member will be available and willing to do this; the best places to ask are the mailing list or at one of the open hack nights.

It is the duty of each member to make sure they are safe and not endangering the people around them.

Safety equipment, such as protective goggles, is readily available within the workshop. We also have hard hats, gloves and face masks.

Your actions in the hackspace are not the liability of Nottingham Hackspace Ltd or anyone else within it.  This is simply not true, unfortunately.

“Before we use any power tools, let's take a moment to talk about shop safety. Be sure to read, understand, and follow all the safety rules that come with your power tools. Knowing how to use your power tools properly will greatly reduce the risk of personal injury. And remember this: there is no more important safety rule than to wear these — safety glasses.”
