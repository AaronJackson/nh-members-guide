Health & Safety
===============

**Health & Safety is the responsibility of every member of Nottingham Hackspace.** It is the duty of each member to make sure they are safe and not endangering the people around them.

The Hackspace has a lot of potentially dangerous tools available to members; if you are not confident with a tool or machine, or haven't used it before, you should ask to be inducted on it. For machines without specific inductions (see the Teams section), another member will typically be willing to provide advice; the best places to ask are the Google Group or an Open Hack event.

Safety equipment (PPE) is readily available within the workshop; a range of PPE such as goggles, gloves, face masks, and other such items are kept ready for use by all members and topped up on a regular basis.

Additionally, a lone worker alarm with emergency buttons are provided next to the safety equipment. If you are working in the space on your own, it is good practice to keep one of these buttons on you so that you can call for help if needed. Please replace it when you are finished. If pressed, the alarm will call a number of members who live close by.

When in doubt about another member's safety do approach them to discuss it, or raise it with the `Safety Team`__. Every Hackspace member has the right and responsibility to challenge unsafe behaviours.

The following quote provides good guidance on workshop safety:
“Before we use any power tools, let's take a moment to talk about shop safety. Be sure to read, understand, and follow all the safety rules that come with your power tools. Knowing how to use your power tools properly will greatly reduce the risk of personal injury. And remember this: there is no more important safety rule than to wear these — safety glasses.”
