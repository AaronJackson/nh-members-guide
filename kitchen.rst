The Kitchen
===========

The kitchen is equipped with storage, tea making facilities, a microwave, a dishwasher and two fridges. Tea and coffee are free to members, but you’ll probably have to provide your own milk and there is a donations jar in the kitchen if you’d like to contribute any extra toward them. Mugs are in the cupboard above the sink and the fridge on that side of the room is also for members to store things such as drinks or lunch. Please use everything you keep in there, or dispose of it before it goes off.

Please recycle! In the kitchen you will find recycling bins for cardboard, cans, plastic bottles, etc.
