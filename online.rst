The Hackspace Online
====================

Websites
--------

Main website
````````````
The main website for the hackspace is: www.nottinghack.org.uk. This is our main public-facing site where events, workshops and links to other online resources are available.

Wiki
````
We run a wiki here: https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/NottingHack.  You can use your HMS account details to log into the wiki and make edits.

As a new member you should have received a link in your email telling you how to sign up for a Wiki account and submit a feed to our planet - used for blog entries.

Planet Nottinghack
``````````````````
If you blog about hackspace relevant stuff, you’d be most welcome to contribute your feed to Planet Nottinghack. Many members run their own blogs, & this automatically uses RSS to collect them all into one place: http://planet.nottinghack.org.uk/.  If you would like to be included on this, you just need to open a pull request against the GitHub repository.  If you’re not sure how to do this then ask on the google group.

Hackspace Management System (HMS)
`````````````````````````````````
HMS was developed by hackspace members to organise and manage our ever-increasing group. Every hackspace member has an account on HMS which is accessible here:

https://lspace.nottinghack.org.uk/hms/

Then click “Already a member? Login”.

Within HMS you can check your Snackspace account (more about that later) and book various tools.

Hackspace Newsletter

Twitter
```````
There are two Twitter accounts relevant to the hackspace:
* @HSNotts is the general Twitter account,
* @Holly533MHz is the voice of our server, tweeting about the various sensors built into the space. The latter account is locked down and we need to verify you as a member before it’ll accept a follow request.

Flickr
``````
https://www.flickr.com/groups/nottinghack/

The Nottinghack account on Flickr contains all the photos that are automatically uploaded from the Hackspace camera.  You can normally find this hanging from a hook on the wall next to the giant “H” in the studio - please take pictures of the project you are working on!

If you are already a member of Flickr, you can contribute photos to the Nottinghack Group as well.

IRC
```
There is also a #nottinghack IRC channel, located on chat.eu.freenode.net. There will sometimes be a board member in there on any given day, although traffic is often quiet so don't be disheartened if it seems empty.
