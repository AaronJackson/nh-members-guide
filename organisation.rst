Hackspace Organisation
======================

Nottingham Hackspace is registered as a non-profit limited company (Reg. No. 07766826). If there is any surplus after rent and other expenses have been paid, it is spent on tools and consumables.

There is a seven person board of trustees elected to oversee the hackspace, ensure financial sustainability and vote on critical issues. All of the board are volunteers. **Members' meetings are held publicly, in the hackspace at 20:00 on the first Wednesday of each month.** These meetings are open to all Nottinghack members. Votes conducted at meetings are also open to all members.

Please find details of the board members here: http://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Board

Board elections take place each May, any member can stand for election. There's more information available about our constitution on the wiki:

Teams
-----
The day-to-day running of the hackspace is done by you and every member.
The various activities are run by teams, which are outlined here:

Safety
``````
Safety is RULE 0!
 The safety team shall schedule regular (frequency to be discussed) walk-arounds of the space to identify new safety risks and monitor existing issues. The team shall record any findings and present the details to the membership.
 “Before we use any power tools, let's take a moment to talk about shop safety. Be sure to read, understand, and follow all the safety rules that come with your power tools. Knowing how to use your power tools properly will greatly reduce the risk of personal injury. And remember this: there is no more important safety rule than to wear these — safety glasses.”
 The safety team page is at Safety_Team. Please do get involved via the mailing list.

Tools

The tools team is starting to look at all our tools to see what further tools we need, and what may need replacing. If you would like to help, please email: tools@nottinghack.org.uk There is a wiki page here.
