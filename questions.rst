Questions
=========

If you have any questions or requests, the best place to ask is Discord. We have a warm and growing community there, full of people who are happy to help out and provide quick responses. If you're a new member, you can also ask questions from the tour guide before the weekly tour, starting at 19:00.

Membership enquiries and handled through the membership team: membership@nottinghack.org.uk.

If you need to discuss something in private, or have a complaint, please contact the trustees at trustees@nottinghack.org.uk.

We’d like to emphasise that the hackspace is your space as much as it’s everyone else’s. Just like every other member, you’re paying a share of the running costs. We strongly encourage you to get to know other members, ask questions & talk a bit about your own projects. We look forward to seeing you at the space more!
