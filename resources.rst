Resources
=========

In the hackspace you’ll see stores of things like wood, metal and electronics components. There are also boxes full of general hardware, enclosures, etc and craft resources such as fabrics, buttons, threads and zips.

All of these resources are free for members to use.

Please don’t take too much. “Too much” is down to your judgment.
