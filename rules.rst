Hackspace Rules
===============

0. Do not be on fire.
    In everything, first and foremost look after your own and others safety.
1. Pay what you like but pay monthly.
    Nobody gets free membership, because it costs money to run the Hackspace. Membership costs are up to you, all we ask is that your subscription covers the use you get from the space.
2. 35L storage.
    All members paying £10 or more per month get storage space if they want it. This is usually a 35L box, but see page 10 for exceptions.
3. Talk is cheap.
    Hackspaces are full of ideas. Getting stuff done always trumps talking and as long as something won’t interfere with the space or other members, then it’s okay to go ahead. If you're worried about this, ask on the mailing list.
4. No CRTs.
    The Hackspace gets offered a lot of donations, but does not accept CRTs. Old TVs and monitors are obsolete, power hungry tech and very few people want them anymore.
5. Do not hack means do not hack.
    Certain things in the space are there to be used rather than hacked. It should be obvious with most things, but in cases where it’s not you can make it so by putting a “DO NOT HACK” sign on it. The sign MUST also include your name, the date it was last worked on and contact details.
6. Clean up after yourself.
    Don’t leave a wake of tools, offcuts, dust and crockery. The Hackspace has members, not staff.
7. No overnight sleeping.
    While at present we’re permitted 24 hour access, under the terms of our lease the space is not for overnight sleeping.
8. Don't be a contemptible fellow (be excellent to each other)
    This is our main rule of behaviour. It takes priority over all other rules.

We ask that members keep their projects and actions at the space legal.
