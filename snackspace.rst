Snackspace
==========

There is a vending machine for snacks (and electronic kits!), you can pay for these either with cash or using your members RFID card.

If you buy items on your members RFID card then you will be invoiced via an email at the end of every month. Please pay this off using the note machine in the members storage room.

If there’s something you’d like to see in snackspace, you can email us at snackspace@nottinghack.org.uk. We currently restock weekly, on a Wednesday.
