Storage
=======

Any member paying £10 or more in membership per month is entitled to keep a 35 litre box at the space in the storage area. A box costs £5, becomes your property, & stacks with all of the other member’s boxes at the space. If you’re paying over £20, then you’re welcome to keep two boxes if you need them. The best way to get one is to pay in cash at an open hack night, or when you’re in the space with a board member. If you have a box, we ask that you put your real name and some contact details on it. Some members also put their Twitter names on their boxes too.

The Large Project Shelves (abbreviated to LPS) work on a three to six monthly cycle. Once every three months, the shelves are audited. Any project not adequately labelled (see Do No Hack section) is marked as such. If it remains on the shelves in three months time, still inadequately labelled, it will be removed from the Hackspace.

Projects are welcome on the shelves for as long as is required - as long as they are adequately labelled and worked on every three months. Projects that remain on the shelves for six months without being worked on will be removed from the Hackspace.
