The Studio
==========

Our Studio contains many tables to work at, designed for projects that donâ€™t require heavier tools or are 'clean' work such as prototyping, programming, craft, etc. At the back of the studio is a large cutting table available for use on cutting material or assembling overly large items. The studio is home to Snackspace and our main Large Project Storage shelving.

On the far wall there is a list of benefactors that made it possible for us to move into such a large space.
