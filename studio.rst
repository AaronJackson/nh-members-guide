The Studio
==========

In the Studio there are many tables to work at, where people work on projects that donâ€™t require the heavier facilities. At the back of the studio is a large cutting table positioned in front of the Craft Room. On the far wall, there is also a list of benefactors that made it possible for us to move into such a large space.

On this wall you can also find the hackspace camera - please use this to take pictures of your project.  This automatically uploads to the public hackspace Flickr account, so no rude pictures please!
