Tools
=====

We have a lot of tools here that are there for members to use, but some of them are dangerous power tools and some of them are on long-term loan rather than belonging to the space.

If in doubt, or if you’ve never used a particular tool before, ask someone how to use it safely. It’s very important to your personal safety and the ongoing use of the hackspace that you don’t mess with dangerous equipment if you’re not trained to use it.

When using equipment, warn the people around you and brief them to act safely if you feel it necessary.

Look after the tools, don’t circumvent safety features and please put everything back after you’ve finished using it.

Tools - Maintenance and Inductions

Maintenance
-----------

If you find a broken tool, or break one yourself, don’t panic!  Tools break all the time, and you are not in trouble.  Email tools@nottinghack.org.uk with details of the broken tool, and make sure others don’t try and use it - if it is a small tool put it into the broken tools bin near the dusty area, if it is a big tool, put a “broken tool” tag on it, which you can also find near the dusty area.

Inductions
----------

We ask everyone to assess themselves with regards to using the tools - Do you have prior experience? Have you read the manual? Have you looked up safe working practices for the tool? Are you using appropriate safety equipment? Are you aware of others around you and any issues this might raise?

If in ANY doubt, please ask or seek additional training.

Inductions are required on equipment that is potentially very dangerous or that is expensive.

At present an induction is required before members can use the following equipment:

* Laser cutter
* Metal lathe
* Metal milling machine
* Welding equipment
* 3D printer

In some cases, to operate this equipment you will need to use your members RFID card, which is placed on a reader which checks to see if you have been inducted.
