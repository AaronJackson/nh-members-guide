The Wrokshop
============

The heart of Nottingham Hackspace is the workshop, where you’ll find most tools along with various consumables. Facilities in the workshop include workbenches, an electronics bench complete with oscilloscopes and PCB etching equipment, bike parking and repair facilities, a laser cutter, hand and power tools for joinery, a large sink plus screen printing equipment and a metalworking area with metal lathe, milling machine and welding equipment. Some of the tools and facilities in here are on loan from other members.
